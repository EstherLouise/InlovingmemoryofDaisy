      <h1>Our beloved fur baby❤</h1>
      <p><em>07.24.2008/03.25.2022</em></p>
      <p>You weren't just a dog, you were family</p>
      <p><strong>Our home feels empty without you😢</strong></p>

      <h2>More about our angel</h2>
      <p>Daisy was everything you could wish for in a dog. <br>
        She was crazy, funny, awkward, energetic,loyal and so much more. <br>
      All she wanted was to love and be loved.</p><br>
      <p><em>"I remember the first time I saw Daisy. She was so small and full of life. <br>
      We adopted her as a puppy when me and my siblings were still young.<br>
      I was 14 at the time and Daisy changed my life in so many ways.<br>
      She was there for me through all the good and bad times.<br>
      I basically grew up with her, she was my fur baby and best friend.<br>
      Life will always feel empty without her, but I'm grateful to God she was my fur baby
      for so many years".</em> - <strong>Esther</strong></p>

      <h3>She changed our lives forever</h3>
      <p>It took Daisy a while to get comfortable,<br> but once she got to know someone..she loved with all of her little heart💕</p>
      <p><strong>No other fur baby can replace our Daisy</strong></p>

      <p><em> RIP our angel, until we meet again🌹<em></p>
